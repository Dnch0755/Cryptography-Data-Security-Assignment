# Cryptography-Data-Security-Assignment
This project demonstrates a component-based approach to the Data Encryption Standard (DES). To satisfy assignment requirements, our team of 8 has created 8 interoperable Python programs. Each script functions as an independent module—handling specific tasks like Key Generation or S-Box substitution—while ensuring that the output of one module serves as the precise input for the next.
